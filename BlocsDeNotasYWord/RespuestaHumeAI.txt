Egbe I think your conceptualization of the scores is basically correct. The scores produced by our expression measurement models represent the likelihood someone would interpret the expression as one of the target emotions. A higher score indicates a stronger likelihood, while a smaller score indicates a smaller likelihood. This is not in accordance with the user's experience, but in how they are expressing themselves. 

The expressions of someone who is not very emotive, or monotoned, would reliably yield lower scores. However, how someone expresses something is not the same thing as their experience. 

In general it is safe to say that the models cannot read minds or measure a person's experience. They only measure the indicators within an expression. 

Something novel and important about the models is that each dimension is predicted independently, so the models produce individual scores for each dimension. This allows the results to account for the nature of expressions being highly dimensional (we don't feel one emotion at a time, but rather a blend of emotions.)

So to clarify: a score of 1.0 for joy does not mean the subject is extremely joyful. It means there is an extremely high likelihood that another person would perceive the expression as joyful.

Zachary Thank you so much for the explanation!! Just a few follow up questions! 

When you mention : "Something novel and important about the models is that each dimension is predicted independently, so the models produce individual scores for each dimension"

Does each emotion constitute as a single dimension? So Joy, Sadness, etc., are separate and distinct dimensions? 

Also!  are the probability estimates based on a logit model or a probit model?

Egbe  Yes, that is correct! Each emotion label constitutes a single dimension. So Joy and Sadness are considered different dimensions within the expression and are predicted independently. This is to say the predicted score for Joy in no way influences the predicted score for Sadness. 

I took the logit vs probit model basis question back to the research team and I am awaiting a response. 

Here are a few publications relevent to the topic:
